# Setup
## Python
1. Make sure [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your computer.

## Create virtual environment
For this example, we're going to use a virtual environment to keep the package versions separate from what you have installed on your system
1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder you want to create dashboards in by running the following:
   ```shell
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment by running the same:
   ```shell
   # create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # for windows
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   # for linux or Mac (remove hashtag first)
   # source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
2. Install the Power Bpy module:
   ```shell
   # install the Power Bpy module
   pip install powerbpy
   ```
   
3. Write a script to create a dashboard. (This one's up to you!)

4. When you're ready to create the dashboard, run the script by running the following in the command prompt window.

  ```shell
  python name_of_your_script.py
  ```
